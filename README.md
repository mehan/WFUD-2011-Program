# WFUD-2011-Program
World's Fair Use Day (WFUD) was a conference organized by [Public Knowledge](https://www.publicknowledge.org/), which aimed to highlight the work of creators who rely on the doctrine of fair use in order to reuse and remix copyrighted content. I curated the 2010 and 2011 WFUD conferences and served as lead organizer.
